Software project: Visual Odometry Using Essential Matrix Estimation.

The algorithm is taken from Uwe Helmke: Essential Matrix Estimation Using Gauss-Newton Iterations on a Manifold.

/final/ contains all necessary algorithms to Estimate the Essential Matrix between two frames.


/eval/ contains some results on the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite from the KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology).

/data/ contains already matched points and formatted groundtruth data to the sequences 00 - 02 from the KITTI data set.
